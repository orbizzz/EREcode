# EREcode

This repo contains all using code for the Energy Resource Engineering bachelor's degree paper

## TimeSeriesTransformers

You can test with alltest.sh in TimeSeriesTransformers directory.

All datasets except custom dataset can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy)

## ViT-Pruning

It's about Vision Transformer Pruning with channel selection module.

But it's quite messy code so just use as a reference code.

## Informer-Pruning

You can test a simple informer pruning with Informer-Pruning/informer.ipynb. (Using L1 regularization and magnitude pruning)
